        Rick and Morty is the Emmy award-winning half-hour animated hit comedy
        series on Adult Swim that follows a sociopathic genius scientist who
        drags his inherently timid grandson on insanely dangerous adventures
        across the universe. Rick Sanchez is living with his daughter Beth’s
        family and constantly bringing her, his son-in-law Jerry, granddaughter
        Summer, and grandson Morty into intergalactic escapades.
