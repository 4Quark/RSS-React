        Rick and Morty is the Emmy award-winning half-hour animated hit comedy
        series on Adult Swim that follows a sociopathic genius scientist who

        across the universe. Rick Sanchez is living with his daughter Bethâ€™s
        family and constantly bringing her, his son-in-law Jerry, granddaughter
        Summer, and grandson Morty into intergalactic escapades.
